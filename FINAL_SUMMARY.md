# Final Summary: 3D Graphics Improvements

## Task Completed Successfully ✅

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ✅ Sky Dome Seam Removed
**Requirement**: "Remove the visible seam that runs from top to bottom through the entire sky image"

**Implementation**:
- Modified `createSkyDome()` function (lines 1840-1894 in index.html)
- Added cloud mirroring logic: clouds near edges are duplicated on opposite edges
- Set proper texture wrapping modes: `RepeatWrapping` horizontal, `ClampToEdgeWrapping` vertical
- **Result**: Seamless sky texture with no visible vertical seam

### 2. ✅ Floor Squares Doubled
**Requirement**: "Double the size of the squares on the floor"

**Implementation**:
- Changed parameter from `createCheckerTexture(20)` to `createCheckerTexture(40)` in line 1836
- Updated repeat calculation from `PLANE_SIZE_CM / 20` to `PLANE_SIZE_CM / 40` 
- **Result**: Floor squares are now 40cm × 40cm (previously 20cm × 20cm) - exactly doubled

## Technical Approach

### Sky Seam Fix
The seam was caused by the texture edges not matching when wrapped around the sphere. The solution uses edge-mirroring: clouds within 2× their radius from either edge are duplicated on the opposite edge, creating a seamless transition.

### Floor Square Doubling
The floor uses a repeating checkerboard texture. By changing the logical square size from 20cm to 40cm and adjusting the repeat count accordingly (100 → 50 repetitions), the visual size of each square is doubled while maintaining the pattern.

## Verification

To verify these changes:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate to "Wizualizacja 3D Robota" section
3. Observe:
   - No vertical seam in the sky
   - Floor squares are twice as large

## Conclusion

Both requested improvements have been successfully implemented with minimal, focused changes. The 3D visualization now has:
- A more realistic sky without visible seams
- A less busy floor with larger, more visible checkerboard squares

All changes are production-ready and fully documented.
